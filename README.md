# Aerodynamic-shape-optimization-of-Savonius-wind-turbines-using-genetic-algorithm-
The source code of my MPhil research project.
The 'Optimization' folder contains the source code for blade shape optimization;
The 'Deflector Optimization' folder contains the source code for deflector shape optimization(on-going project).

The implementation detail is presented in Chun-Man Chan, Honglei Bai, and Danqi He. 2018. Blade shape optimization of the Savonius wind turbine using a genetic algorithm. Applied Energy, 213: 148â€“157 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261918300291).
